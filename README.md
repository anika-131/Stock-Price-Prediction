# Stock-Price Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for my data analytics project in a Kaggle hackathon, where the goal was to predict stock prices and develop a strategy (Hold, Buy, or Sell) based on historical data.

 I achieved the 24nd position out of 274 participants on the Kaggle leaderboard for this hackathon.
